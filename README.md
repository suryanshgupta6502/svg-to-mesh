# svgToMesh

`svgToMesh` is a JavaScript utility function that converts an SVG file into a 3D mesh. This function is ideal for turning 2D vector-based graphics into 3D models that can be used in WebGL or other 3D environments.

## Installation

If you're using a package manager like npm, you can install `svgToMesh` by running:

```bash
npm install svgToMesh

import { svgToMesh } from 'svgToMesh';

import { svgToMesh } from 'svgToMesh';

const url = 'path/to/your/svg/file.svg';
const options = {
  depth: 2,
  color: '#ff6347',
  position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
  scale: 1.5,
}

const meshGroup = svgToMesh(url, options);

```
